# Kalman-fusion-method
A Kalman fusion method used in bathymetry inversion
You need to calculate the former error of input models
You only need to input the models need fuse and the errors in this function
One parameter in this function is the value 's' which control the number of iterations
You can change this value 's' to control the iteration speed.
